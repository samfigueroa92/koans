    # THINK ABOUT IT:
    #
    # Why does Ruby provide both send and __send__ ?
      # send is a commonly used method in Ruby for invoking 
      # a method dynamically. However, because send is a 
      # public method, if a class defines its own send method, 
      # it would override the default send method provided by Ruby. 
      # This could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to use 
      # send for its original purpose.
      
      # To address the potential conflict described above, Ruby 
      # provides __send__ as an alias for the original send method. 
      # Because it uses underscores, it's less likely to clash with 
      # user-defined methods. It's meant as a reliable fallback that 
      # you can use to access the original send method even if 
      # it's overridden in a class.

  #
  # Both obj.msg and obj.send(:msg) sends the message named :msg to
  # the object. We use "send" when the name of the message can vary
  # dynamically (e.g. calculated at run time), but by far the most
  # common way of sending a message is just to say: obj.msg.

    # THINK ABOUT IT:
    #
    # If the method :method_missing causes the NoMethodError, then
    # what would happen if we redefine method_missing?
      # If you redefine the method_missing method in a class, 
      # you're essentially providing custom behavior for handling 
      # method calls that the object doesn't understand. 

    # NOTE:
    #
    # In Ruby 1.8 the method_missing method is public and can be
    # called as shown above. However, in Ruby 1.9 (and later versions)
    # the method_missing method is private. We explicitly made it
    # public in the testing framework so this example works in both
    # versions of Ruby. Just keep in mind you can't call
    # method_missing like that after Ruby 1.9 normally.

    # Thanks.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled Ruby
